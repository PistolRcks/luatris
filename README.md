# luatris
A version of the classic four-piece block game in Lua through LÖVE. Because why not.

## Dependencies
* Lua 5.1
* LÖVE 11.1

## Running
Run `love game` in the `luatris` folder. Simple as that.
If you don't have LÖVE installed on your computer, provide the path to the executable instead of `love`
